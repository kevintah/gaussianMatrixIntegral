# gaussianMatrixIntegral
Integration of Gaussian Matrices are common in Physics. A Gaussian matrix integral was suggested on Youtube, done by hand in a slightly different manner, and implemented in code in a different manner all arriving at the same answer. I have been told that these come up in the simplest quantum field theories but alas how would I even know :P
